This is dev branch.
- database_helper (sqflite) has been added
- saved_choices_screen.dart has been added
    - choices can be created and saved
    - choices saved are stored in the sqlite db
    - they can be viewed in this screen
    - choices can be edited or deleted
    - during the edit of a choice:
        - if image is modified, the new modified image thumbnail does not appear on the edit screen
        - but when the choice is saved, the changed image appears then
        - this is due to the fact that the choices are being pulled from the db and only when the choice is saved in db it is visible on the screen
        - same happens with editing the audio
        - this needs modification
- homescreen.dart has been modified to add an icon to view the saved choices
- existing functionality while creating new choice board does not implement the database sqlite, but continues to use the shared_preferences
- Functionality to add all new choice boards to the database remains to be done.
- Currently the database sqlite implementation part remains only in the dev branch.
